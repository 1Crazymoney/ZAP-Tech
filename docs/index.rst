ZeroLaw Augmentation Protocol
#############################

The ZeroLaw org-Augmentation Protocol (ZAP) is a general-purpose tech/law stack for augmenting any business entity or organization through the use of smart contracts and shares deployed to Ethereum or any other EVM-based blockchain. It is non-rent-seeking, fully free and open source and is neither funded by nor requires the use of any protocol token. It is intended to be compatible with a range of legal compliance strategies or applicable legal regimes by providing tunable compliance parameters; it is even compatible with antilaw positions. ZAPâ€™s compliance parameters may be tuned "all the way up", "all the way down" or anywhere in between; thus, ZAP is suitable for any entity or organization, ranging from traditional corporations to anarchic, pseudonymous collectives. ZAP merges the vision of a borderless, decentralized future with the power to comply with existing legal requirements & best practices for doing business. ZAP has been developed by ZeroLaw, an independent law/technology team working to make technology and legal agreements interoperable. Anyone may contribute to the protocol.

ZAP was developed by `ZeroLaw <https://zerolaw.tech>`__.

How it Works
============

ZAP is designed to maximize interoperability between different network participants. Broadly speaking, these participants may be split into four categories:

* **Orgs** are entities that create and sell shares to fund their operations.
* **Verifiers** are trusted entities that provide verification services for network participants.
* **Members** are entities that have been verified and are are able to hold or transfer security shares.
* **Custodians** hold shares on behalf of members without taking direct ownership. They may provide services such as escrow or custody, or facilitate secondary trading of tokens.

The protocol is built with two central concepts in mind: **identification** and **permission**. Each member has their identity verified by a verifier and a unique ID hash is associated to their wallet addresses. Based on this identity information, orgs and custodians apply a series of rules to determine how the member may interact with them.

Orgs, verifiers and custodians each exist on the blockchain with their own smart contracts that define the way they interact with one another. These contracts allow different entities to provide services to each other within the ecosystem.

Tokenized shares in the protocol are built upon the ERC20 token standard. Shares are transferred via the ``transfer`` and ``transferFrom`` methods, however the transfer will only succeed if it passes a series of on-chain permissioning checks. A call to ``checkTransfer`` returns true if the transfer is possible. The base configuration includes member identification, tracking member counts and limits, and restrictions on countries and accredited status. By implementing other modules a variety of additional functionality is possible so as to meet the needs of each individual org.

Components
==========

ZAP is comprised of four core components:

1. :ref:`orgshare`

    * ERC20 compliant token contracts
    * Intended to represent a corporate shareholder registry in book entry or certificated form
    * Permissioning logic to enforce enforce legal and contractural restrictions around share transfers
    * Modular design allows for optional added functionality

2. :ref:`org-code`

    * Common owner contract for multiples classes of shares created by the same org
    * Detailed on-chain cap table with granular permissioning capabilities
    * Modular design allows for optional added functionality
    * Multi-sig, multi-authority design provides increased security and permissioned contract management

3. :ref:`kyc`

    * Whitelists that provide identity, region, and accreditation information of members based on off-chain verification
    * May be maintained by a single entity for a single share issuance, or a federation across multiple jurisdictions providing identity data for many orgs
    * Multi-sig, multi-authority design provides increased security and permissioned contract management

4. :ref:`custodian`

    * Contracts that represent an entity approved to hold shares on behalf of multiple members
    * Deep integration with OrgCode to provide accurate on-chain member counts
    * Multiple implementations allow for a wide range of functionality including escrow services, custody, and secondary trading of shares
    * Modular design allows for optional added functionality
    * Multi-sig, multi-authority design provides increased security and permissioned contract management
